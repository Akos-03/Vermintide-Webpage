            <h3>Waystalker</h3>
    
            <div>
                <p>“At last, a bit of real wilderness. It almost reminds me of home.”</p>

                <p>Waywatchers guard the hidden paths of Athel Loren, holding vigil against intruders of all kinds.
                     Those threats they can end with bow or blade, they do so gladly, for trespass is a crime that carries a heavy price in the domain of the wood elves. 
                     Thus are armies and raiding parties blunted - or even slaughtered wholesale - long before they reach Athel Loren's heartlands.</p>
    
                <p>The defence of Ubersreik brought Kerillian a focus she had never before known. 
                    Disgusted by the Skaven machinations, and despairing of her companion's clumsy efforts, she resolved to hone her Waywatcher's skills to a Waystalker's perfection, 
                    becoming a rightly-feared shadow in the night. Every shot is a kill, or accompanied by a muffled curse and a silent resolve do to better. 
                    For Kerillian, the paths of the Empire are now her hunting ground as much as those of Athel Loren ever were.</p>
    
                <p>Kerillian the Waystalker reflects her ever-increasing skills with a bow and arrow. 
                    The Waystalker specialises in elven archery in all its forms, be it pinpoint precision work or sheer volume of arrows loosed against the enemy hordes.</p>

                    “Death for the sake of death. That's not soldiering. It's the work of beasts.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    Not all the Empire's battles are fought in a clash of battle lines, regimental colours whipping and snapping in the breeze. 
                    In the tangled murk of the Reikwald, and a hundred other forests, determined huntsmen track raiding warbands, laying them low with volleys of arrows and lead shot. 
                    It isn't soldiering as understood in the barrack-rooms of Altdorf, but it is vital work, nonetheless. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Kruber has always sought a simpler life. He grew to manhood in Taal's sight, 
                    and a youth spent on his parents' farm gave him a taste for the labours of the soil. 
                    Had he not enlisted, Kruber would still have found himself caught up in war,
                     for in an Empire under siege no man keeps what he cannot fight for - soldier and farmer alike too easily become slave. 

                </p> 
                <p>
                    After Ubersreik, Kruber realized his disillusionment of army life wasn't temporary and with the ghosts of his past still clawing at his soul, 
                    he sought solace and found it in returning to his roots. 
                    By walking the wilds of the Empire and devoting himself to Taal and Rhya, the Gods of Nature, Kruber was allowed to breathe and focus, 
                    at least as long as he had a stiff drink or two at hand. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Huntsman, Kruber favours the weapons of the deepwoods - the arrow and the bullet.
                     He cuts a very different figure without uniform and armour, 
                     but he is all the lighter on his feet for that, 
                    able to stay one step ahead of the foe, and rain down death from afar.
                </p>

            <h3>Ranger Veteran</h3>
        
            <div>
                <p>
                    “See them scatter! Okri would love this!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rangers forsake the dark comfort of hearth and hold,
                     roaming far and wide to vanquish foes far from the walls of their homes. 
                     They seldom receive proper appreciation from their dwarfen brethren and are all too often 
                     viewed as eccentric, or even wits-addled. Nonetheless, they are vital to a hold's ongoing defence, 
                     hardened as they are by the harsh environments of the surface world, 
                    and accomplished in the arts of tracking and ambush. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bardin's experiences in Ubersreik have honed his skills to that of a Ranger Veteran. 
                    Steady of hand and keen of eye, he adapts swiftly to the horrors vomited forth from the shadows and battles 
                    implacably until they breathe no more. The search for Karak Zorn still weighs heavy upon Bardin,
                     but the Reikland's perils compel him to attend to more urgent matters. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In battle, Bardin the Ranger favours a head-on approach, using his arsenal of ranged
                     weapons to punish the foe from afar. Yet he is no stranger to the press of melee. 
                     Should the need arise, dwarfen steel will punish those enemies foolish enough to stray 
                     within Bardin's reach. 
                    Maybe not with the same flourish as Cousin Okri, but near enough to count.
                </p>
            </div>
