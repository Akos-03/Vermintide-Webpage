        <h3>What is this page about?</h3>

        <div>
            <p>This is a page created as a project given by the University of Szeged. The topic has been chosen for the reason that I, the creator,
                love the game, its design and its world.</p>

            <p>On this home page, I will sum up the contents of the sub page's contents and give a short summary of the reasons behind the choices made, during the creation of the site.</p>

            <p> The subpages provide an overview of the 5 main heroes of the game and some of their subclasses. Each subpage has it's own style made specifically for them based on the subclasses origin.</p>

        <h3>What is the reasoning behind the design choices?</h3>

        <div>
            <p>The page took inspiration from the art direction and menu setup of the game, and as such is attempting to pay tribute to the creators.
                The images used by the site are the intellectual property of FatShark, I do not claim them as my own, I do not plan on using them for commercial purposes.</p>

            <p>The page is written entirely in english, because the places and names fit the language better. It would look awkward to have english names next to hungarian text,
                and it would cause technical difficulties, since some fonts used on the site do not support hungarian accentuated letters. </p>
